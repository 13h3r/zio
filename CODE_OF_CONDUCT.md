# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or
other such characteristics.

The ZIO project follows the [Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/), with
adjustments with clarifications with regard to moderation that are detailed below.
All participants, contributors and members are expected to follow the Scala Code of Conduct
when discussing the project on the available communication channels. If you are being harassed, 
please contact us immediately so that we can support you.

## Moderation and Steering Committee
 
The ZIO project's group of moderators is the Steering Committee team. The members currently are:
* Itamar Ravid (@iravid)
* John De Goes (@jdegoes)
* Kai (@neko-kai)
* Paul Shirshov (@pshirshov)
* Salar Rahmanian (@softinio)

The ZIO project requires that drastic moderation actions detailed in the code of 
conduct - for example, removing a user from the Gitter channel - be agreed upon
a group of over 2/3rds of the steering committee.

For any questions, concerns, or moderation requests please contact any member of
the project, or the people listed above.

## BDFL

In addition to the above, the ZIO project's BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) is
John De Goes (@jdegoes), owing to his original founding of the project and continued
investments in it. While John adheres to the same code of conduct as everyone else,
he is entitled to override moderation decisions made by the steering committee.
